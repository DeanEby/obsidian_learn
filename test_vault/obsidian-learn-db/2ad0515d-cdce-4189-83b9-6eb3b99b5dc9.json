      "The scientific method consists of asking a question, conducting background research, formulating a hypothesis, testing with an experiment, analyzing data, drawing a conclusion, and communicating results.",
      "Different research designs (experimental, correlational, descriptive, longitudinal) serve different purposes in scientific investigation.",
      "Quantitative methods focus on numerical data for statistical analysis, while qualitative methods explore non-numerical data to understand concepts and experiences.",
      "Sampling methods include probability sampling (simple random, stratified, cluster, systematic) and non-probability sampling (convenience, purposive, snowball, quota).",
      "Research ethics emphasize informed consent, confidentiality, avoiding harm, the right to withdraw, and debriefing."
