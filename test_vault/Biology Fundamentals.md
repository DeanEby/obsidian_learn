# Biology Fundamentals

## Cell Structure

The cell is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms. Cells are the smallest units of life, and they are often called the "building blocks of life."

There are two main types of cells:

1. **Prokaryotic cells**: Simpler cells with no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, found in bacteria and archaea.
2. **Eukaryotic cells**: More complex cells with a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.

Key components of a eukaryotic cell include:

- **Cell membrane**: Selectively permeable barrier that controls what enters and leaves the cell
- **Nucleus**: Contains the genetic material (DNA)
- **Mitochondria**: Powerhouse of the cell where cellular respiration occurs
- **Endoplasmic reticulum**: Network of membranes involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism
- **Golgi apparatus**: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins for secretion or use within the cell
- **Lysosomes**: Contain digestive enzymes for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris

## DNA and Genetics

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It carries the genetic instructions for development, functioning, growth, and reproduction.

The structure of DNA is a double helix consisting of two strands running in opposite directions. Each strand is composed of nucleotides, which contain:

- A sugar molecule (deoxyribose)
- A phosphate group
- One of four nitrogen-containing bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C)

The genetic code uses the sequence of nucleotides to form genes, which then encode proteins. The central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic information:

DNA → RNA → Protein

## Evolution

Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over generations. The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace and explains how species adapt and change over time.

Key principles of evolution include:

- **Variation**: Individuals in a population show differences in traits
- **Heritability**: Some traits can be passed from parents to offspring
- **Differential reproduction**: Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce
- **Adaptation**: Over time, populations become better suited to their environments

Evidence for evolution comes from multiple sources:
- Fossil record
- Comparative anatomy
- Molecular biology
- Biogeography
- Observed instances of evolution in action

## Ecosystems

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. The biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.

Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction, typically from primary producers (plants) through various trophic levels:

1. **Producers**: Autotrophs like plants that convert solar energy to chemical energy
2. **Primary consumers**: Herbivores that eat plants
3. **Secondary consumers**: Carnivores that eat herbivores
4. **Tertiary consumers**: Carnivores that eat other carnivores
5. **Decomposers**: Organisms that break down dead organic material

Ecosystems are characterized by:
- Food chains and food webs
- Energy pyramids
- Biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water, etc.)
- Community interactions (competition, predation, symbiosis, etc.)
