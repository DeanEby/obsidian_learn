# Ancient History

## Mesopotamia

Mesopotamia was an ancient region located within the Tigris–Euphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq, Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish–Syrian and Iran–Iraq borders.

It's widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, where the earliest developments of human civilization occurred. Key achievements include:

- Development of the first writing system (cuneiform)
- Formation of the first cities and urban centers
- Creation of the wheel and first plow
- Early developments in mathematics and astronomy

The most prominent civilizations included the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.

## Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was a civilization in Northeast Africa concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, in what is now modern Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization began around 3100 BCE with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.

Key features of ancient Egyptian civilization:

- Construction of monumental architecture like the pyramids and the Sphinx
- Development of hieroglyphic writing
- Complex religious beliefs centered around death, rebirth, and the afterlife
- Advanced knowledge of medicine and astronomy

Ancient Egypt is particularly famous for its elaborate burial practices, including mummification and the construction of elaborate tombs like the Pyramids of Giza.

## Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th–9th centuries BCE to the end of antiquity. The civilization is credited with laying the foundations for Western civilization, including:

- Democracy and concepts of citizenship
- Philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle)
- Theatre and dramatic arts
- Olympic Games
- Advances in mathematics, science, and medicine

The Classical Period (5th and 4th centuries BCE) is particularly notable for the development of democracy in Athens and the conquests of Alexander the Great.

## Roman Empire

The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia.

The empire was characterized by:

- Extensive engineering achievements (roads, aqueducts, public buildings)

At its height under Trajan, the Roman Empire controlled approximately 6.5 million square kilometers of land surface.
