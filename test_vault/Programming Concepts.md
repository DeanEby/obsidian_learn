# Programming Concepts

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

Key features of OOP include:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism for creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the procedural programming, which emphasizes changes in state.

Key concepts of functional programming include:

- **Pure functions**: Functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects
- **Immutability**: Once a variable is assigned, it cannot be changed
- **First-class functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables
- **Higher-order functions**: Functions that take functions as arguments or return functions

## Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Arrays

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows for faster access to an element at a specific index.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

### Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Trees

A tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
